        lyrics: `Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes`,

        lyrics: `This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Where you go, I go
What you see, I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall

Yeah.
Yeah?
Talk to me.
You want me to tell you something? I know what you want to hear.
I know you want me baby, I think I want you too.
I think I love you baby.

I think I love you too. I'm here to save you girl,
come be in shady's world.
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl.
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too.
They call me superman; I'm here to rescue you.
I want to save you girl, come be in shady's world.

Oh boy you drive me crazy.

Bitch you make me hurl.

They call me superman, leap tall hoes in a single bound
got no ring on this finger now.
I'll never let another chick bring me down,
in a relationship save it bitch, baby-sit?
You make me sick, superman ain't saving shit,
girl you can jump on shady's dick.
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase,
I tell the motherfuckin slut to her face.
Play no games, say no names,
ever since I broke over what’s her face.
I'm a different man kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask, kiss my dick get my cash.
I'd rather have you whip my ass, don't put out, I'll put you out.
Wont get out, I'll push you out. Puss blew out; popping shit wouldn't piss on fire to put you out.
Am I too nice? Buy you ice,
bitch if you died wouldn't buy you life.
What you trying to be my new wife? What you Mariah? Fly through twice.

But I do know one thing though
bitches they come they go,
Saturday through Sunday, Monday.
Monday through Sunday yo.
Maybe I'll love you one-day maybe we'll someday grow.
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fucking runway hoe.

Cause I can't be your superman,
can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
can't be your superman.
I can't be your superman,
can't be your superman,
can't be your superman,
your superman, your superman.

Don't get me wrong,
I love these hoes its no secret, everybody knows.
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what that as far as your booty goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again I chase you around every bar you attend
you'll never know what kinda car I'll be in.
We'll see how much you'll be partying then.
You don’t want that; neither do I.
I don’t wanna flip when I see you with guys.
Too much pride, between you and I not a jealous man but females lie.
But I guess that’s just what sluts do.
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you, we just met and I just fucked you.

But I do know one thing
though bitches they come they go,
Saturday through Sunday, Monday.
Monday through Sunday yo.

You know you want me baby, you know I want you too. They call me superman; I'm here to rescue you. I want to save you girl, come be in shady's world.

Oh boy you drive me crazy.

First thing you said:

I'm not faced; I hang around big stars all day. I don’t see what the big deal is anyway; you’re just plain old Marshall to me.

Oh yeah girl run that game.
Hailie Jade I love that name,

Rot in Pieces, uh that’s great.

First off you don’t know Marshall,

I'll slap you off that barstool; there goes another lawsuit.
Leave handprints all across you.
Good lordy wody you must be gone off that water bottle you want what you cant have oh girl that’s too damn bad
don’t touch what you can't grab,
end up with two back hands.
Put anthrax on a tampax and slap you till you can’t stand.
Girl you just ruined your chance,
don’t mean to ruin your plans.

But I do know one thing though
bitches they come they go,
Saturday through Sunday, Monday.
Monday through Sunday yo.
Maybe I'll love you one-day maybe we'll someday grow.
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fucking runway hoe.

        lyrics: `You've been my muse for a long time
You get me through every dark night
I'm always gone, out on the go
I'm on the run and you're home alone
I'm too consumed with my own life
Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move
Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound
Of breaking down
I've been confused as of late (yeah)
Watching my youth slip away (yeah)
You're like the sun, you wake me up
But you drain me out if I get too much
I might need room or I'll break
Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move
Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound
Of breaking down
I don't want to play this part
But I do, all for you
I don't want to make this hard
But I will 'cause I'm still
Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now (I know I would)
Doing what I can, tryna be a man (be your man)
And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound
Of breaking down`,

A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
There's a few lines that I have wrote
In case of death, that's what I want
That's what I want
So don't be sad when I'll be gone
There's just one thing I hope you know
I loved you so
'Cause I don't even care about the time I've got left here
The only thing I know now is that I wanna spend it
With you, with you, nobody else here
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
I'm sorry, but I gotta go
If you'll ever miss me, give this song
Another go
And I just keep on thinking how you made me feel better
And all the crazy little things that we did together
In the end, in the end it doesn't matter
If tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest`,

Will you be forever with me?

When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no, I said no
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh, at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
Broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide`,

So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Baby, it's the way that you can see
What I miss and what I can never be

Maybe you were wrong and I was right
I don't care, won't you stay another night?
I just need some time to be myself
I couldn't say "I need you" on that night
When you left and I lost all track of time
I just want you close so I can feel you
Can you feel me? Mm
And nothing says "I love you" like the words
That were never said, but could be heard
If only there was peace around us, baby
You would hear me
And maybe it's the way that lovers do
I just want for me what I want for you
Only with the sun above us maybe
You would see me
Mm, mm, mm
And even if you leave, I may be fine
'Cause my heart, it has its own design
And even if you never see it, baby
You're all that I need
Maybe it's the silence in your eyes
Maybe it's the lilac when you're shy
Maybe it's the mystery of your love
All I need is a sign from the stars above
Maybe it's the way that you breathe in me
Maybe it's the man that you see in me
Maybe it's the fragrance of your hair
Yeah, I just wanna kiss you when you're there
I just want you all around me, baby

So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say something so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
Even when the night changes
Even when the night changes
Chasing her tonight
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Driving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
Even when the night changes
Even when the night changes`,

        lyrics: `I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Mm, oh
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person, and she looks perfect
Though I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight`,

Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
Ay, ay, leave before you love me
I'm so good at knowing
Of when to leave the party behind
Don't care if they notice, yeah, yeah, no
I'll just catch a ride
I'd rather be lonely, yeah
Than wrapped around your body too tight
Yeah, I'm the type to get naked
Won't give my heart up for breaking
'Cause I'm too gone to be stayin', staying (dancing on)
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far

Look what we found, Karma reached out
Into our hearts and pulled us to our feet now
You know, the truth is we could disappear
Anywhere, as long as I got you there

(ਨੂਰ ਦਾ ਮੈਨੂੰ ਘੁੱਟ ਪਿਲਾਏ)
(ਜਿੰਦੜੀ ਬਣ ਜਾਏ)
You're glowing (ਅੰਬਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਤੂੰ ਝਾਲਰ ਪਾਏ)
You colour and fracture the light (ਬਦਲ਼ਾਂ ਦੇ ਲੱਠੇ ਸੂਟ ਬਣਾਏ)
But look at you tonight (ਕਿਰਣਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਰੰਗ-ਰੂਪ ਛਡਾਏ)

ਪਲਕਾਂ ਉਠਾਵਤੇ ਹਨੇਰੇ ਘਟਦੇ
ਉਂਗਲਾ’ਚ ਪਾਕੇ ਤੂੰ ਧਨਕ ਫਿਰਦੀ
ਕਿਵੇਂ ਰੱਬ ਨੇ ਦੋ ਨੈਣਾਂ ਉੱਤੇ ਨੀਲਮ ਜੜੇ?

Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night

When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no, I said no
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh, at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
Broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide`,
